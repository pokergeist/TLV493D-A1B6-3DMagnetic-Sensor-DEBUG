The 3D magnetic sensor TLV493\+D-\/\+A1\+B6 offers accurate three-\/dimensional sensing with extremely low power consumption in a small 6-\/pin package. With its magnetic field detection in x, y, and z-\/direction the sensor reliably measures three-\/dimensional, linear and rotation movements. Applications include joysticks, control elements (white goods, multifunction knops), or electric meters (anti tampering) and any other application that requires accurate angular measurements or low power consumptions. The integrated temperature sensor can furthermore be used for plausibility checks.

Key features are 3D magnetic sensing with a very low power consumption during operations. The sensor has a digital output via 2-\/wire based standard I2C interface up to 1 MBit/sec and 12 bit data resolution for each measurement direction (Bx, By and Bz linear field measurement up to +-\/130mT).\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Key Features and Benefits}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}

Please see the example sketches in the {\ttfamily /examples} directory in this library to learn more about the usage of the library.

Currently, there exist two separate evaluation boards\+:

The 3D Magnetic Sensor 2GO is an evaluation board equipped with the magnetic sensor \href{https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/tlv493d-a1b6-ms2go/}{\texttt{ TLV493\+D-\/\+A1\+B6}} for three dimensional measurement combined with an ARM® Cortex™-\/\+M0 CPU. The 3D Magnetic Sensor 2GO has a complete set of on-\/board devices, including an on-\/board debugger. A PDF summarizing the features and layout of the 3D magnetic sensor 2GO board is stored on the Infineon homepage \href{https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-3D-Magnetic-Sensor_EvalKit_UM-UM-v01_01-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d462525dbac40152ac4ca1d318c2}{\texttt{ here}}.

Please note that base of the Sensors 2GO is the XMC 2Go from Infineon. Therefore, please install (if not already done) also the \href{https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino}{\texttt{ XMC-\/for-\/\+Arduino}} implementation and choose afterwards {\bfseries{XMC1100 XMC2\+Go}} from the {\bfseries{Tools}}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}{\bfseries{Board}} menu in the Arduino IDE if working with this evaluation board.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{TLV493\+D-\/\+A1\+B6 3\+DSense Shield2\+Go}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
The TLV493\+D-\/\+A1\+B6 3DMagnetic Shield2\+Go is a standalone break out board with Infineon\textquotesingle{}s Shield2\+Go formfactor and pin out. You can connect it easily to any microcontroller of your choice which is Arduino compatible and has 3.\+3V logic level (please note that the Arduino UNO has 5V logic level and cannot be used without level shifting).

\end{DoxyItemize}

However, every Shield2\+Go is directly compatible with Infineon\textquotesingle{}s XMC2\+Go and the recommended quick start is to use an XMC2\+Go for evaluation. Therefore, please install (if not already done) also the \href{https://github.com/Infineon/XMC-for-Arduino}{\texttt{ XMC-\/for-\/\+Arduino}} implementation and choose afterwards {\bfseries{XMC1100 XMC2\+Go}} from the {\bfseries{Tools}}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}{\bfseries{Board}} menu in the Arduino IDE if working with this evaluation board. To use it, please plug the TLV493\+D-\/\+A1\+B6 3DMagnetic Shield2\+Go onto the XMC2\+Go as shown below.
